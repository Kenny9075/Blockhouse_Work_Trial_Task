# Blockhouse Temporary Impact gt(X)

This repo is the result and solution of my preliminary research for the modeling of the temporary impact function gt(X). A inverse function-based strategy is proposed as well in order to minimize slippage and optimizing trades. 3 types of regression models were utilized in order to benchmark the results of this analysis.

Notes:
All the modeling and analysis were conducted using Level 1 book data
3 ticker datasets: FROG, CRWV, and SOUN
The strategy was developed given 60000 shares and 390 minutes of data/day
The result of the strategy demonstrates the difference between the simulated slippage value and computed value
